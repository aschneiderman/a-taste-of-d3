<h1>Class 1: The Basics</h1>

<p> The following are the links to working versions of each of the data visualizations and notes about each visualization.</p>

<p> To get access to the code behind the examples, you'll need to  <a href="https://github.com/datachefs/a-taste-of-d3/archive/gh-pages.zip">download it</a> from A Taste of D3's <a href="https://github.com/datachefs/a-taste-of-d3/">GitHub site</a>.</p>

<h2>A)  Intro</h2>
<h2>B) Quick and Dirty:  HTML, CSS, SVG</h2>


<div class="example">1) <a href="01-10-SVG-Circle-Rectangle.html">Creating a rectangle and a circle</a></div>
 Key Concepts:
 <ul><li> Both HTML, which is used to create text, and SVG, which is used to create graphics, are just text with tags</li>
   <li> CSS can be used to change the look and feel of both HTML and SVG</li></li>
 <li> You can put CSS inside an HTML file, or you can reuse it by putting it in a separate file and pointing to it</ul>
<div class="yourTurn">Your Turn: change the color of the rectangle or the circle</div>

<h2>C) Very Simple D3</h2>

<div class="example">1) <a href="01-20-Data-Into-Circles.html">Turn Simple Data into Circles</a></div>
 Key Concepts:
 <ul><li>Learning most programming, you only have to do with one new concept at a time, D3.JS throws a bunch of concepts at you right at the start</li>
   <li> But don't sweat it! The patterns you see here you'll use over and over and will become second nature:</li>
   <ul><li>selectAll, data, enter, append: the most common pattern for creating a data viz.</li>
     <li> Yeah, using 'selectAll("circle")' when you <b>know</b> there are no circles is weird -- but it's a very common pattern and you'll get used to it</li>
     <li>function(d,i), a.k.a. an anonymous function looks weird, but again very common pattern you use over and over</li></ul>
</ul>

<div class="example">2) <a href="01-30-Data-into-Circles-Three-Ways.html">Turn Data into Circles Three Ways</a></div>
 Key Concepts: small tweaks, big changes
 <div class="yourTurn">Your Turn: Try changing color, spacing, see what happends  </div>

 <h3>Debugging Basics </h3>

<h2>D)  Simple Real-World Examples</h2>
<h3> Simple Clothing Sales <a href="01-40-Simple-Bar-Chart.html"> Bar Chart</a> (more complex data) </h3>
Key Concepts:
<ul>
  <li> Data: array of objects</li>
  <li> It's pretty, but took a lot of work and isn't close to being done -- needs legend, etc.</li>
</ul>
<div class="yourTurn">Your Turn: switch from sales to purchases  </div>


<h3> <a href="01-50-SIG-Status-Reading-Data-File.html">SIG Status</a> (reading data from a file)(doesn't work yet) </h3>
  Key concepts:
  <ul>
    <li> Reading data from a file</li>
    <li> Using conditional logic for color</li>
    <li> Beginning to think about scalable solutions -- e.g., new data from a file each month </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="yourTurn">Your Turn:change the colors in the conditional logic</div>
