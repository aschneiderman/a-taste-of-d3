<h1>A Taste of D3</h1>

<p>This website has the sample code and notes for the class, A Taste of D3.</p>

<h2>The Idea Behind This Class</h2>
<p>Trying to teach all of D3 in one class is pretty hard.  It's particularly tricky if you're trying to figure out
how to use D3 to do things that Excel, Tableau, etc can't do.  </p>

<p>So rather than trying to cover all of D3, A Taste of D3
tries to give students a quick intro to D3 and a feel for what it can do -- and what's easy and hard to do.</p>
