<h1>Class 4: Brainstorming</h1>

<p> The following are the links to working versions of each of the data visualizations and notes about each visualization.</p>

<p> To get access to the code behind the examples, you'll need to  <a href="https://github.com/datachefs/a-taste-of-d3/archive/gh-pages.zip">download it</a> from A Taste of D3's <a href="https://github.com/datachefs/a-taste-of-d3/">GitHub site</a>.</p>

<h2>A) Inspirations</h2>
<p>Examples of <a href="http://datachefs.github.io/d3-snacks/examples.html">what D3 can do</a></p>

<h2>B) Brainstorming: Shiny, Strategic, Scalable</h2>
<p> Now it's time to do our first brainstorming session. What are some D3 visualizations that would make sense for your unit and/or ASHA
  that would be </p>
  <ul><li><b> Shiny</b>: Fun, pretty, playful, etc.</li>
    <li><b> Strategic</b>: Would actually be useful for your unit and/or ASHA -- help to obtain a specific goal, better understand/visualize a problem, etc.</li>
    <li><b> Scalable/Sustainable</b>: Not too difficult to update, and if possible parts or all of it could be reused</li></ul>
