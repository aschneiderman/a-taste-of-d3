    <h1>Class 4: Brainstorming</h1>
    <p> The following are the links to working versions of each of the data visualizations and notes about each visualization.</p>
    <p> To get access to the code behind the examples, you'll need to  <a href="https://github.com/datachefs/a-taste-of-d3/archive/gh-pages.zip">download it</a> from A Taste of D3's <a href="https://github.com/datachefs/a-taste-of-d3/">GitHub site</a>.</p>

    <h2>A) Inspirations</h2>
    <p>
       Let's spend the first half of the class looking at examples that can help inspire us and show us a broader rannge of what's possible to do in D3:
    </p>
<ul>

    <li>Examples of <a href="http://datachefs.github.io/d3-snacks/examples.html">what D3 can do</a></li>
    <li>An example of how to be <a href="playful.html">playful with data</a></li>
  </ul>

    <h2>B) Brainstorming: Shiny, Strategic, Scalable, Safe</h2>
    <p> Now it's time to do our first brainstorming session.  According to the Shiny Object Task Force, when you're considering creating a data viz that's beyond your typical bar chart, it should meet three criteria: </p>
      <ul><li><b> Shiny</b>: Fun, pretty, playful, etc.</li>
        <li><b> Strategic</b>: Would actually be useful for your unit and/or ASHA -- help to obtain a specific goal, better understand/visualize a problem, etc.</li>
      <li><b> Scalable/Sustainable</b>: Not too difficult to update, and if possible parts or all of it could be reused</li>
    </ul>
<p>
  For A Taste of D3, we're going to add a fourth S:
  <ul>

    <li><b>Safe</b>:  Since you're new and nobody at ASHA is an expert at D3, now's not the time to come up with something splashy for the Convention.  Pick a project that's clearly experimental, that has no hard deadlines -- where you have plenty of room to fail if you need it.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    Now that you know what objectives you need to meet, what ideas do you have for some problems where a solution might be something fun in D3?
    Today, you don't need to worry about exactly what D3 visualization you want to build.  All you need is a general sense of the kind of problem you want to solve and a few wisps of ideas of what you might want to explore to solve them. </p>
