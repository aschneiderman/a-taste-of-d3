<h3>Notes to Move Elsewhere</h3>
    <i>
Also understanding why this gets tricky -- because of the fact that you can't on a separate command line schedule a transition to go right after another transition</p>

  <!-- <p> Bostock's  <a href="examples/chained-transitions-circles.html">Chained Transitions Circles</a>: -->
  <ul><li> I basically understand what each is doing -- But I need to test to make sure, by putting in a terminal console command to check that the each slide command is happening after every</li>
    <li><b>Reading up about functions so I can explain what the bizarre ()'s around the function are for</b></li>
    <li> Asking the Google group about whether this is creating infinite recursion or if this is a case of declarative versus procedural programming:
    <br/><pre>
      is this approach infinite recursion?  Why doesn't that cause say memory problems?
Or is this related somehow to the first question?
Or am I misreading the code?  Bostock seems to say here that it's not recursion, it's being scheduled (declarative instead of procedural??)
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17975783/recursive-recurring-animation-events-in-d3
You canâ€™t schedule an infinite number of transitions ahead of time. :) However, you can repeatedly schedule a new transition when the old transition ends (or starts), using transition.each to listen for end (or start) events.

  </ul>

<h2>Alternative Strategy: Using a Timer (??)</h2>
<i>
<ul>
  <li> Check out the infinite queue, to see how it works? As precursor to the Action Center Matrix?</li>
  <li>2 little dots moving along?</li>
  <li> A little circle going around the track?</li>
<li> Using buttons and other interactive controls? (Or leave that for pilot projects?)</li>
<li> What else to take a look at?</li>
</ul>
